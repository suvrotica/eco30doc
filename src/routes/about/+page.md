# Eco30 Carbon Offset Project: An Introduction

Immutable Carbon Offsets, in our pursuit to curb the deceitful practice of greenwashing, have established a decentralized protocol for carbon offset registration and ecological restoration. Greenwashing, the act of distorting or fabricating a company's environmental virtues, lures customers into believing that products hold greater ecological benefits than they truly possess. This deception may manifest in baseless claims or by emphasizing a product's sustainable attributes, all while obscuring the company's detrimental environmental activities.

By the year 2030, Eco30 envisions a greener world, with 10 billion newly planted trees aiding in the fulfillment of global carbon offset demands and the revitalization of critical ecosystems. Our solution, the Decentralized Autonomous Registry (DAR), oversees the process of tracking and validating carbon offset tokens, distributing value across the ecosystem. By tethering token values to tangible initiatives with verifiable, accountable impacts, we foster sustainable growth. Through the integration of blockchain, QR codes, computer vision, autonomous drones, and artificial intelligence, we aspire to provide additionality and transparency.

Our clientele encompasses corporations, governments, and institutional investors who share our expanding environmental ambitions. These entities seek to capitalize on the voluntary carbon offset market, projected to burgeon to $50-$100 billion by 2030. Immutable carbon offsets rest on three central tenets:

1. DAR (Decentralized Autonomous Registry) for certification and governance
2. A decentralized database powered by drone flights, AI algorithms, and QR codes
3. Tokenization of immutable carbon offsets on the blockchain

Our tokenization aligns ecological incentives for all participants, furnishing the necessary trust, transparency, and security. Ultimately, we aim to extend our reach to other nations and various stages of carbon removal, encompassing coral reefs and ocean restoration. Our initial foray begins in Costa Rica. Prior to the Initial Decentralized Exchange Offering (IDO), we seek $3 million in pre-seed equity capital.
